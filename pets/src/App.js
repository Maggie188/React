     question: 'Why do dogs wag their tails?',

    question: 'Why do dogs have whiskers?',

    question: 'Why do dogs have wet noses?',
    answer: 'Dog noses secrete a thin layer of moisture that helps to absorb scents. Then, they lick their nose, so they can essentially taste those scents. Having a wet nose is also one of the ways that dogs can regulate their body temperature.'
    },
    {
    question: 'Why does my dog lick me?',
    answer: 'Dogs will often lick their owner or other people as they like the taste of their skin and as a sign of affection. For dogs, licking releases pleasurable endorphins and releases stress.'

    {
    question: 'Why do dogs eat grass?',
